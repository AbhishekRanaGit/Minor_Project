        <h3>Face Tracking</h3>
        <p class="para">
            Face Tracking Technology detects and tracks the presence of a human face in a digital video frame. This technology can be incorporated into computer and mobile applications, and can even be used in robotics. Face Tracking Technology can be used online or offline. <br> <br>

        <h3>Face LandMark Detection</h3>
        <p class="para">Face Landmark Detection is the process of finding points of interest in an image of a human
            face. It has recently seen rapid growth in the computer vision community because it has many compelling
            applications. <br> <br> To achieve this, the landmark detector must find dozens of points on the face, such
            as corners of the mouth, corners of eyes, the silhouette of the jaws, and many more.

        <h3>Face Expression Detection</h3>
        <p class="para">Facial Expression Recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into
            various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on.
            <br> <br>
            The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize <br> emotions as well
